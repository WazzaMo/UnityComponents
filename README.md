# UnityComponents
## Introduction
Some example C# components for the Unity Game Engine.
This was produced for examples and use in the Monash Arts Design and Architecture
Masters of Tangible Interaction Design course for Unit MDC5215.

## Using the Components
These components should work with Unity v5.6x but were developed on 2017.1.
They will work with any edition of Unity (since Unity Technologies gives
the same editor for all subscription levels).

### Namespace
The components are all under the *Actor* or *Tools* namespace and can be cloned or unzipped to the Assets Folder of your project.
This will create the `UnityComponents` folder and put all examples and code in that.

## Examples
The Drag-n-Drop example demonstrates a drag source, draggable icon and drag target for drag-n-drop UI.
The library include an extension for the unity editor to provide menus for creating all the various gameobjects in your own scene more easily without using prefabs or hacking the demo scene.

The general examples folder shows a number of different elements mixed together, I'll eventually get around to separating it out like the Drag-n-Drop example.
