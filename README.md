# UnityComponents
## Introduction
Some example C# components for the Unity Game Engine.
This was produced for examples and use in the Monash Arts Design and Architecture
Masters of Tangible Interaction Design course for Unit MDC5215.

## Using the Components
These components should work with Unity v5.6x but were developed on 2017.1.
They will work with any edition of Unity (since Unity Technologies gives
the same editor for all subscription levels).

### Namespace
The components are all under the *Actor* namespace and should be in the WazzaMo
directory in the Assets Folder of your project.
